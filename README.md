## Overview
Imitating sounds with one's voice is a natural way of delivering an audio concept in human-to-human communication. If a machine could undersand human's vocal imitation, users could be able to interact with machine in this natural way for various audio-related tasks. 

The ImitationSet is a collection of crowd-sourced vocal imitations of a large set of diverse sounds collected from freesound (https://freesound.org/), which were curated based on Google's AudioSet ontology (https://research.google.com/audioset/). We expect that this data set will help research comunities obtain better understanding of human's vocal imitation and build a machine understand the imitations as humans do.
